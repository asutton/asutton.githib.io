{"name":"Andrew Sutton","tagline":"Home Page","body":"I am an assistant professor in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.uakron.edu/computer-science/) at the [University of Akron](http://www.uakron.edu) in Akron, Ohio.\r\n\r\nMy research interests are at the intersection of Software Engineering and Programming Languages, and in particular their application to systems programming. I am currently working on two major projects: improved language support for generic programming in C++ (i.e., concepts), and language and runtime system support for Software Defined Networking (SDN).\r\n\r\nI am also a director at [Flowgrammable.org](http://flowgrammable.org/), a research organization dedicated to improving the state of the art in Software Defined Networking. My primarily role in this organization is coordinating research efforts with the other directors and mentoring participants in the development of research and technologies.\r\n\r\nPrior to my appointment at the University of Akron, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University where I worked with [Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.stroustrup.com/) and Gabriel Dos Reis on improved language support for generic programming in C++.\r\n\r\nI graduated from Kent State University with a PhD in Computer Science in August 2010. My advisor was [Jonathan Maletic](http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/) and I worked in the Software Development Laboratory (\\<SDML\\>).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
