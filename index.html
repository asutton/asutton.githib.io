      <section>
        <p>I am an assistant professor in the Department of <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/computer-science/">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.uakron.edu">University of Akron</a> in Akron, Ohio.</p>

<p>My research interests are at the intersection of Software Engineering and Programming Languages, and in particular, their application to systems programming issues. I am currently working on two major projects: improved language support for generic programming in C++, and language support for Software Defined Networking.</p>

<p>I am also a director at Flowgrammable.org, a research organization dedicated to improving the adoption of Software Defined Networking. My primarily role in this organization is coordinating research efforts with the other directors and mentoring participants in the development of research and technologies.</p>

<p>Prior to my appointment at the University of Akron, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University where I worked with Bjarne Stroustrup and Gabriel Dos Reis on improved language support for generic programming in C++ (that is, concepts). This is work is being developed as an ISO Technical Specification, targeted for inclusion in C++ in 2017. An implementation is available in a branch of GCC (still under development).</p>

<p>I graduated from Kent State University with a PhD in Computer Science in 2010. My advisor was Jonathan Maletic and I worked in the Software Development Laboratory ().</p>
